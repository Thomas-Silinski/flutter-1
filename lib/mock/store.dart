        '''A bot alone is no guarantee of success. Many prominent botters run multiple types of bots for major releases, because each one has different strengths and weaknesses. Some botters rent dozens of computer servers in the same facilities as the retailers to save milliseconds on data latency.
Mr. Titus said he understands the frustration some sneaker buyers may feel about bots. But as he sees it, he is merely providing tools that people want. That includes retailers who have seen bots generate demand for their products.
"While they have to act like they're trying to stop bots, it's making them a huge profit," he said.
He has developed a friendly rivalry with Mr. Lemieux. When Mr. Titus showed off a new Tesla, Mr. Lemieux suggested that he decorate the car with some Shopify decals.
Mr. Lemieux said Mr. Titus "is a very, very good programmer" and that he would try to hire him for Shopify if he were willing to cross over to the other side.
"I've had some nice interactions with him," Mr. Titus said. "Obviously we can't disclose too much of what either of us are doing because it's kind of a cat-and-mouse game between Shopify and us."
Ahead of a special release, the New Balance 990v3 to celebrate Bodega's 15th anniversary, the boutique and Shopify had devised a few obstacles to slow the bots down. The first was to place the product on a brand-new website with an unguessable address â€” analogwebsitewrittenonpaper.com.
Right away, botters saw this as a deterrent.
"We may have to go manual," said Trevor Roskovensky, a sneaker buyer, in a YouTube video of him trying to buy the shoe live.
Bodega also added a question that shoppers had to type out the answer: What are the last four letters of the alphabet? After that, shoppers had to complete a challenge of drawing boxes around airplanes.
